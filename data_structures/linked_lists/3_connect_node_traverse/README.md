#  Connect Node Traverse

## Motivation
Linked lists are one of the most commonly used data structures in any programming language.
Every node in a single linked list contains an item and reference to the next item and that's it.

## Problem Description
Build a Python class `Node` containing 2 instance variables `self.data` and `self.next`  to initialise the node object . Create another class `LinkedList` having 1 `self.head` instance function to initialize head.

Create LinkedList object `llist` , 2 Node objects `llist.head` and `second`.

Build logic to Link first node with second object,  tranverse through the elements of the data structure by performing a LinkedList function call `PrintList` to return data items.
