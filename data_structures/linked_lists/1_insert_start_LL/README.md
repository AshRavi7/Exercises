#  Insert Data Start

## Motivation
Depending upon the location where you want to insert an item, there are different ways to insert items in a single linked list.

Inserting Items at the Beginning-
The simplest way to insert an item in a single linked list is to add an item at the start of the list.

## Problem Description
Write a program to insert data into the linked list at the start of the data structure. 

Build a Python class `Node` containing default instance `self.data`=None  and `self.next` to initialise the node object.Create another class `LinkedList` having instance `self.head`=None.
Class `LinkedList` contains 2 functions  `traverse` and `insert_at_start`.

Create LinkedList object `items` peforming few calls to `insert_at_start` ,finally call function `traverse` to display the items.
