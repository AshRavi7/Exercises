#  Insert Data End 

## Problem Description
Write a program to insert data into the linked list at the end of the data structure. 

Build a Python class `Node` containing default instance `self.data`=None  and `self.next` to initialise the node object.
Create another class `LinkedList` having instance `self.head`=None.

Build logic in class `LinkedList` having  functions  `traverse` ,`insert_at_start` and `insert_at-end`.

Create LinkedList object `items` which performs calls to `insert_at_start` , `insert_at_end` and finally `traverse` to display the items.
